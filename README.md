# pandagma_scripts
A repository for scripts used to prepare filesi, process results, and for running pandagma on Ceres.

Files include config files, get_data scripts, sbatch scripts for running pandagma on 
Ceres (or similar server), and all  pre- and post-processing scripts. **These files
need to be copied into the pandagma directory after cloning the Pandagma repository.**

Pandagma is available [here](https://github.com/legumeinfo/pandagma). Information for
installing and running the pipeline can be found in the README file.

The pan-gene and grass family loading scripts are in the support_scripts repository, 
directory PanGenome.
